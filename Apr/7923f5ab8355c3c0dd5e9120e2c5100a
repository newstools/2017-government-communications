18 April 2017 Imbizo Week schedule Government will embark on the 6th National Imbizo Focus Week of the current Administration from 17 to 23 April 2017. President Jacob Zuma has declared 2017 as the year of Oliver Reginald Tambo. This year marks the centenary of the late President and national Chairperson of the ANC, an international icon and hero of the South African liberation struggle. In celebrating his legacy, National Imbizo Focus Week will focus on the implementation of our National Development Plan (NDP) vision 2030, which underpins the Medium Term Strategic Framework 2014-2019. The week is principally a heightened period of engagements between Members of the executive and citizens through on-going dialogues. During the Focus Week, leaders across the three spheres of government will interact with citizens countrywide.  “Government encourages communities to participate in the izimbizo and engage with government officials across the country, in addressing public service challenges in order to improve and provide a better life for all”, said the Minister of Communications, Ms Ayanda Dlodlo. The Minister further added, ”The Imbizo Focus Week takes place during Freedom Month and before Freedom Day, 27 April 2017, where, on this day in 1994, South Africans from all walks of life celebrate the historical day when they first cast the vote for a free democratic country”.
