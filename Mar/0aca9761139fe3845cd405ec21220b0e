31 March 2017 Government welcomes the appointment of Ministers and Deputy Ministers to the Executive, following a Cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma. Government is confident that the new Ministers and their Deputies, together with current serving Ministers who have moved to different portfolios, will work tirelessly to bring about radical socio-economic transformation and move the country towards an upward trajectory. “The appointments made by the President are aligned to improving efficiency and effectiveness in the system and government is confident that the Ministers and their Deputies will hit the ground running to ensure the continuity of government programmes to realise Vision 2030, which is to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality,” said Acting GCIS Acting-Director General, Donald Liphoko. The National Development Plan (NDP), the country’s blueprint, was developed to address the country’s pertinent issues and government is enthusiastic about partnering with the new principals to implement the NDP and move South Africa forward. Government also thanks the outgoing Ministers and Deputy Minsters for their dedication and hard work during the tenure and wish them well in their future endeavours.
