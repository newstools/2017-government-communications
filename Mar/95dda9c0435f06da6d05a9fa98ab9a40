28 March 2017Government is deeply saddened by the death of struggle stalwart, Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada and joins the millions of South African in extending its deepest condolences to his friends and family. Government said that the passing on of the revolutionary was a great loss for South Africa. Kathrada was one of the accused in the famous Rivonia Trial and played an instrumental role in the fight against apartheid.He was the recipient of a number of awards, amongst which he received the Isithwalandwe in 1992, the highest award bestowed by the ANC and in the late 90s the late President Nelson Mandela handed Kathrada the Presidential Award of the Order for Meritorious Service Class 1 in recognition of his selfless service to the country. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, members of the Kathrada Foundation, and his friends. Although we are saddened today, we must celebrate the role he played and the sacrifices he made for our country. In his last days, he continued to work towards promoting the values and principles enshrined in the Freedom Charter and the Constitution of South Africa. To God we belong and to him shall we return, said GCIS Director-General, Donald Liphoko.
