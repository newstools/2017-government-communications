24 August 2017 The Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) urges potential employment seekers to be wary of a fake job listing advert that is circulating on social media. The GCIS warns the public to be vigilant as the advert lists vacancies at GCIS, government departments and other organisations. The fake job advert indicates that there are 18 senior secretary and 42 general assistant posts available at the GCIS. The links in the advert opens the website SA Local Jobs. Acting Director-General, Phumla Williams, said: “We are warning the public about the fake advert so they do not fall prey to this scam.  The GCIS advertises its vacancies through the Department of Public Service and Administration, Vuk’uzenzele, the GCIS website and through bona fide media houses.” “Potential job seekers are encouraged to check with a recruiting company to determine if a listed vacancy is legitimate or fake. Caution must be taken especially if an applicant is asked to pay money up-front.” added Williams. Enquiries: Phumla Williams Cell: 083 501 0139
