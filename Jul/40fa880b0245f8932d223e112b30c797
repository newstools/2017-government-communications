To government communicators as well as members of the media, Mr Mamoepa was a colleague, a leader and a mentor whose life is worth celebrating. Minister Dlodlo said “Since the passing on of this giant of our soil, I have witnessed a stream of messages on media platforms from friends, colleagues, government and political leaders within the country and abroad commending him for his excellent service, humility, commitment and outstanding grasp of his work.  This is the Ronnie I knew”. “It is therefore befitting of us government communicators and the media to gather together and share memories about him.  To many he was a pleasure to work with”, she added. Minister Dlodlo invites colleagues in government and the media sector to join the memorial at GCIS Head Office, in Pretoria.  The service will start at 09h00. Those who wish to send messages of condolence through social media are advised to use the hashtag #RIPRonnie.  Condolence books will also be placed at GCIS and Union Buildings for anyone who may wish to come and give a message to the family pre and post the memorial service.
