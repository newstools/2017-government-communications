22 Feb 2017 The JCPS Cluster has noted with concern inflammatory remarks currently circulating on social media. These inflammatory posts are made by South Africans and foreign nationals against each other on social media posts. The threatening posts have been escalating since the recent attacks on homes and property occupied by foreign nationals in Johannesburg and Tshwane. The Cluster calls for these acts that only seek to divide our communities to stop. The JCPS Cluster further appeals on all people to refrain from comments that can deliberately incite the public to commit acts of violence. There is no place in our constitutional democracy for citizens and/or foreign nationals to take the law into their own hands and incite violence.Â  Communities and individuals who feel threatened should follow lawful channels to express their concerns. We would like to assure all people in our country, including citizens and foreign nationals, that the security agencies are aware of the threats that are being circulated on social media. Security measures have been put in place to mitigate against any potential threat. In this 20th year of our democratic Constitution, we remain committed to building a society that is based on democratic values of social justice, human dignity, equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms, non-racialism and non-sexism.
