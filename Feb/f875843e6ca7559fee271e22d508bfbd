15 February 2017 President Jacob Zuma will on Friday, 17 February 2017, via Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) studios, connect live with a number of Community Radio stations across South Africa, where he will unpack the State of the Nation Address the President delivered on 9 February 2017. Acting GCIS Director-General, Donald Liphoko, said: “Government encourages all citizens to tune into their community radio stations to engage with the President. The use of community radio is one of the critical platforms that are available to the public. It provides a two-way sharing of information that promotes and contributes to the public discourse.” Through the GCIS footprint in community media, approximately 6 553 000 listeners will be able to tune in to the President’s engagement. “The interaction between the public and the President is important as it is brings government closer to the people, as we move South Africa forward.” Members of the public are encouraged to call 0800 142 446 during the show.
